    "One really powerful computational technique is [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). In this method, we repeatedly sample random values (from a known distribution) and generate numerical results from that data. We might generate random measurements for a machine part (to see if it still works, or how likely it is to fail), or random measurements for health outcomes to figure out how to allocate resources, or many others.\n",

The part where these sets overlap is a quarter-circle whose area is $\\pi/4$. We can use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of $\\pi$!\n",

The probability of success is then an approximation of $\\pi/4$.\n",
