    "We're almost finished establishing some of our big techniques in simulation. We've learned how to simulate easy-to-describe events (like coin flips and dice rolls), and in the last notebook we learned how to generate exponentially distributed random numbers through a change of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use simulations gain, but this time to investigate the distributions of continuous random variables. Specifically, we will use simlations to estimate the probability that the value of a random variable falls within a specified range, and to estimate the mean and variance of a distribution.  We'll also get more experience working with normally distributed data. Happily, Python has a way to do that: `random.gauss()`. It's called this because normal distributions are also referred to as *Gaussian,* after Carl Friedrich Gauss. For simplicity, we will work with the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$, which has mean zero and standard deviation 1."

Compare your result to Table B.1 (or any other $z$-table!).  \n",

    "(3) Many important distributions can be found by modifying the standard normal one. You will here eplore the  [folded normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folded_normal_distribution). Numbers from this distribution can be generated by first generating values $Z$ from the standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$ and the computing the absolute value $Y=|Z|$ of these numbers. **Estimate the mean and variance** of the folded normal distribution using a simulation. (hint: the absolute value is given by `abs()` in Python. The linked article has the theoretical values if you'd like to compare!).\n",
