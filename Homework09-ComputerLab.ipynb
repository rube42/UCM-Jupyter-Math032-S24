    "<h4>Problem 1 - The Variation of Averages</h4>\n",
    "In class, we considered the experiment where each student flipped a coin 100 times, coded one side of the coin as 1 and the other as 0, and finally computed the average of the 100 coin flips. We noticed that each student got a diffent value of this average. Futhermore, the distribution of the observed averages was sharply peaked at 50% and the width was about 5%. To understand this, we introuced the random varaibles $X_1$, ..., $X_{100}$ to descibe the coin flips, let $\\bar X_{100}$ be the avarage of the coin flips, and finally computed the mean and standard deviation of $\\bar X_{100}$. In this problem you are asked to estimate the mean and standard deviation of $\\bar X_{100}$ using a simulation. (Hint: in the simulation, each loop corresponds to one student, meaning you need to compute the avearge of 100 coin flips in each loop. Also remember that you computed means and averages in previous problem sets.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Problem 2 - The Law of Large Numbers</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will consider how the law of large numbers applies to the coin flip experiment described above. In this context, the law of large numbers says that the the average is garuanteed to approach 0.5 as the number of coin flips increase. Specifically, if $\\bar X_{n}$ is a random variable representing the avearge of $n$ coin flips, the theorem states that $\\lim_{n \\rightarrow\\infty} P(|\\bar X_n-0.5|\\ge\\epsilon) = 0$. To explore this, first set  $\\epsilon=0.01$ and $n=100$ and use a simulation to estimate\n",

    "<h4> Problem 3 - The Central Limit Theorem </h4>\n",
    "In problem problem you will solve problem 4 of the theory homework using a simulation. Specifically, in the theory problem you were asked to use the central limit theorem to estimate the probability that 100 raindrops fall within one minute given that time between subsequent raindrops is exponentially distributed and the expected time is 0.5s. Use a simulation to compute this probaility. (Hint: in this simulation, you will need to simulate 100 raindrops in each loop and check if the event occurred.) Does the answer agree with your answer in the theory homework?\n",
